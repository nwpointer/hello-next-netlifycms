  "body": "## OUR MISSION\n\nGooseberry Doula Care helps women and their partners. My goal is to help families attain their best possible birth experience be it at home, or in the hospital. I offer birth and postpartum doula care packages.\n\nFor hundreds of years, there has been a myth about how babies come into this world by being born under a gooseberry bush.  Gooseberry is also a synonym of third person or a helper of couples. When you work with me, Rachelâ€™s Gooseberry Doula Care, I will strive to be with you and your partner through your journey before, during, and after labor, and to help ease the transition from pregnancy to parenthood for new moms and dads. Our services help you so you can rest and bond deeply to your new baby, and enjoy this special time.",
