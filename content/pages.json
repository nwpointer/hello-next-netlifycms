My goal is to help families attain their best possible birth experience be it at home, or in the hospital. I offer birth and postpartum doula care packages.\n\n\n\n## WHY GOOSEBERRY?\n\nFor hundreds of years, there has been a myth about how babies come into this world by being born under a gooseberry bush.  Gooseberry is also a synonym of third person or a helper of couples. When you work with me, Rachel’s Gooseberry Doula Care, I will strive to be with you and your partner through your journey before, during, and after labor, and to help ease the transition from pregnancy to parenthood for new moms and dads. Our services help you so you can rest and bond deeply to your new baby, and enjoy this special time.\n\n\n\n## CREDENTIALS\n\n* DONA trained doula\n* Advanced Practice Doula Workshop \n* First Aid and CPR certified\n* Led Breastfeeding Workshops","aboutMe":{"primaryText":"RACHEL IS A DONA TRAINED ADVANCED PRACTICE DOULA","secondaryText":"Should be memorable, put you and your partner at ease and leave you feeling wrapped in comfort.","body":"some more content that may not be shown"}},"blog":{"header":"blog","subheader":"“Birth is not only about making babies.
